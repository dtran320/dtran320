👋 Hi, I’m David, a founder, engineer, and ultrarunner.

👨🏻‍💻 Most of the time, you'll find me working on my startup, [Flow Club](https://www.flow.club).
Our mission is to provide accountability, structure, and community to people with diverse working styles,
so that they can feel fulfilled and supported in their work.

I occasionally tweet about running, flow, and startups: Follow me [@dtran320 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dtran320) or [@dtran@sfba.social on Mastodon](https://sfba.social/@dtran)
