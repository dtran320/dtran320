👋 Hi, I’m David— a founder, engineer, and ultrarunner.

👨🏻‍💻 Most of the time, you'll find me working on my startup, [Flow Club](https://www.flow.club).
Our mission is to provide accountability, structure, and community to people with diverse working styles,
so that they can feel fulfilled and supported in their work.

I occasionally post about running, flow, and startups:
- [My blog](https://www.davidtran.me)
- [@dtran320 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dtran320)
- [@dtran on Instagram](https://instagram.com/dtran)
- [@dtran@sfba.social on Mastodon](https://sfba.social/@dtran)
