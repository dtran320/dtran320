👋 Hi, I’m David— a founder, engineer, and ultrarunner.

👨🏻‍💻 Most of the time, you'll find me working on my startup, [Flow Club](https://www.flow.club).
Our mission is to provide accountability, structure, and community to people with diverse working styles,
so that they can feel fulfilled and supported in their work. Join me in a [Phone Free session](https://in.flow.club/host/david-t)

I occasionally write and post about running, flow, and startups:
- [My blog](https://www.davidtran.me)
- [My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davetran/)
